RWA validation implementation:
```typescript
class RWAValidator {
  private perplexityClient: PerplexityClient;
  private secFilingAnalyzer: SECFilingAnalyzer;
  private teamVerifier: TeamVerifier;
  private regulatoryDatabase: RegulatoryDatabase;
  
  constructor() {
    this.perplexityClient = new PerplexityClient(config.perplexity.apiKey);
    this.secFilingAnalyzer = new SECFilingAnalyzer();
    this.teamVerifier = new TeamVerifier();
    this.regulatoryDatabase = new RegulatoryDatabase();
  }
  
  async validateRWAProtocol(protocol: RWAProtocol): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Parallel validation of different aspects
    const [assetVerification, teamVerification, regulatoryCheck, financialValidation] = await Promise.all([
      this.verifyAssetBacking(protocol),
      this.verifyTeam(protocol.team),
      this.checkRegulatoryCompliance(protocol),
      this.validateFinancialData(protocol.financials)
    ]);
    
    // Calculate overall legitimacy score
    const legitimacyScore = this.calculateLegitimacyScore(
      assetVerification,
      teamVerification,
      regulatoryCheck,
      financialValidation
    );
    
    return {
      protocol: protocol.id,
      legitimacyScore,
      assetVerification,
      teamVerification,
      regulatoryCheck,
      financialValidation,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      recommendations: this.generateRecommendations(legitimacyScore)
    };
  }
  
  private async verifyAssetBacking(protocol: RWAProtocol): Promise<AssetVerificationResult> {
    // Use Perplexity API to cross-reference asset claims with SEC filings
    const secFilings = await this.perplexityClient.getSecFilings(protocol.assetIssuer);
    const filingAnalysis = await this.secFilingAnalyzer.analyzeFilings(secFilings, protocol.assetClaims);
    
    // Verify through multiple sources
    const additionalSources = await this.getAdditionalSources(protocol.assetIssuer);
    
    return this.reconcileAssetVerification(filingAnalysis, additionalSources);
  }
}
```
