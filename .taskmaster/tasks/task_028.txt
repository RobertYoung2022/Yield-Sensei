# Task ID: 28
# Title: Complete TypeScript Error Resolution in Non-Critical Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Address the remaining 655 TypeScript errors in test files, demo files, and non-critical components to achieve 100% TypeScript compilation success across the entire codebase.
# Details:
Implement a systematic approach to resolve all remaining TypeScript errors with the following components:

1. Error Categorization and Prioritization
   - Catalog all 655 remaining errors by file type (test, demo, component)
   - Group errors by common patterns (type definitions, null checks, etc.)
   - Prioritize errors based on component dependencies and usage frequency
   - Create a tracking system to monitor progress and identify blockers

2. Test Files Error Resolution
   - Apply proper typing to test fixtures and mock data
   - Implement correct type assertions for test expectations
   - Resolve type incompatibilities in test utility functions
   - Add appropriate type definitions for testing libraries and frameworks
   - Ensure proper typing for async test functions and promises

3. Demo Files Error Resolution
   - Fix type definitions in demonstration components
   - Resolve prop type mismatches in demo UI components
   - Add proper interface definitions for demo data structures
   - Implement correct typing for demo API mock responses
   - Address generic type parameter issues in demo utilities

4. Non-Critical Component Error Resolution
   - Apply consistent interface definitions across related components
   - Fix type narrowing issues in conditional logic
   - Resolve union type handling in component props
   - Implement proper typing for component state management
   - Address callback function parameter and return type issues

5. Utility Function Standardization
   - Leverage utility types established in Task 16
   - Apply consistent generic type patterns across similar functions
   - Implement proper type guards for runtime type checking
   - Standardize error handling with typed exceptions
   - Create reusable type definitions for common patterns

6. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
   - Document common error patterns and their solutions
   - Create examples of correct TypeScript usage for reference
   - Update coding standards documentation with TypeScript best practices
   - Provide guidance for preventing similar errors in future development
   - Conduct knowledge sharing sessions on TypeScript patterns used

# Test Strategy:
1. Incremental Compilation Verification
   - Run TypeScript compiler on subsets of fixed files to verify incremental progress
   - Track error count reduction over time to ensure steady progress
   - Verify each fixed file compiles without errors before committing changes
   - Run full project compilation after major component fixes

2. Automated Testing
   - Execute the existing test suite after each significant batch of fixes
   - Verify that fixing type errors doesn't break existing functionality
   - Add additional type assertion tests where appropriate
   - Ensure test coverage remains consistent after type fixes

3. Code Review Process
   - Conduct targeted code reviews focused on TypeScript patterns
   - Verify consistent application of type definitions across similar components
   - Ensure type fixes follow established patterns from Task 16
   - Check for any performance implications from type system changes

4. Final Verification
   - Run TypeScript compiler with strict mode enabled across the entire codebase
   - Verify zero TypeScript errors in the final compilation
   - Generate TypeScript declaration files and verify their correctness
   - Validate build process completes successfully with all type checks passing

5. Documentation Validation
   - Review updated documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify examples correctly demonstrate TypeScript best practices
   - Ensure coding standards documentation reflects the implemented solutions
   - Validate that knowledge transfer materials cover all major error patterns
