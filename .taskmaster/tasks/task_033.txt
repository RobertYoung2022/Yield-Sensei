# Task ID: 33
# Title: External Service Integrations and API Setup
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement all missing external service integrations required for satellite functionality, including AI service clients (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity), blockchain provider connections, social media API integrations, and institutional data feeds.
# Details:
1. **AI Service Client Integration**: Implement robust client wrappers for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity APIs, ensuring secure management of API keys using environment variables or secure vaults. Abstract authentication and error handling, and provide unified interfaces for downstream modules.

2. **Blockchain Provider Connections**: Integrate with major blockchain providers (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, QuickNode) to enable real-time on-chain data access and transaction broadcasting. Implement connection pooling, failover logic, and rate limit handling for high reliability.

3. **Social Media API Integrations**: Integrate with Twitter, Discord, and Telegram APIs using official SDKs or REST endpoints. Register applications to obtain API credentials, implement OAuth flows for authentication, and design scalable polling or webhook-based listeners for real-time data ingestion. Ensure compliance with platform rate limits and data access policies[1][2][3][4].

4. **Institutional Data Feeds**: Establish connections to institutional-grade data providers (e.g., Bloomberg, Refinitiv, Chainlink) as required by satellite modules. Implement data normalization and validation pipelines to ensure consistency across feeds.

5. **Configuration and Extensibility**: Design a configuration management system to enable dynamic addition or modification of service endpoints and credentials without code redeployment. Document integration points and provide clear extension guidelines for future services.

6. **Security and Compliance**: Enforce best practices for credential storage, access control, and audit logging. Regularly review integration code for compliance with third-party terms of service and data privacy regulations.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**: Write comprehensive unit tests for each service client, covering authentication, error handling, and data parsing.

2. **Integration Testing**: Simulate real-world API interactions for each external service, including rate limit scenarios, authentication failures, and data consistency checks.

3. **End-to-End Testing**: Validate that all satellite modules relying on these integrations can access and process external data as expected.

4. **Security Testing**: Verify that API keys and credentials are never exposed in logs or error messages, and test for unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark API call latency and throughput under expected and peak loads, ensuring the system meets real-time requirements.

6. **Compliance Validation**: Review integration logs and workflows to ensure adherence to third-party API terms of service and data privacy standards.
