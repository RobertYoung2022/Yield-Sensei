# Subtasks:
## 1. Cross-Chain Arbitrage Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a real-time system to detect price discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities across multiple blockchain networks.
### Details:
Implement a high-performance monitoring system that tracks asset prices across different chains, calculates potential arbitrage opportunities, and filters them based on profitability thresholds. Include support for major DEXs across at least 5 blockchain networks with sub-second update intervals.
<info added on 2025-07-25T17:20:23.721Z>
Research findings on cross-chain arbitrage detection techniques should be incorporated into the implementation. The system should utilize hybrid cycle detection algorithms to identify arbitrage paths across multiple chains, leverage empirical transaction analysis to understand historical patterns, and employ simulation-based approaches for opportunity validation. Implementation must prioritize high-frequency data collection with sub-second intervals as specified, and develop robust asset equivalence mapping to accurately track the same assets across different blockchain representations and wrapped token versions.
