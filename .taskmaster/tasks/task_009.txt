    e.mutex.RLock()
    defer e.mutex.RUnlock()
    
    var opportunities []ArbitrageOpportunity
    
    // Get prices from all chains
    prices := make(map[ChainID]map[AssetID]decimal.Decimal)
    for chainID, client := range e.chainClients {
        chainPrices, err := client.GetAssetPrices()
        if err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to get prices for chain %s: %w", chainID, err)
        }
        prices[chainID] = chainPrices
    }
    
    // Compare prices across chains and detect arbitrage opportunities
    for asset := range e.supportedAssets {
        opportunities = append(opportunities, e.findArbitrageForAsset(asset, prices)...)
    }
    
    // Sort by profitability
    sort.Slice(opportunities, func(i, j int) bool {
        return opportunities[i].ExpectedProfit.GreaterThan(opportunities[j].ExpectedProfit)
    })
    
    return opportunities, nil
}

func (e *CrossChainEngine) ExecuteArbitrage(opportunity ArbitrageOpportunity) (TransactionResult, error) {
    // Execute the arbitrage opportunity
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance testing for <1s opportunity window capture
2. Simulation testing with historical cross-chain data
3. Integration testing with multiple blockchain networks
4. Security testing for cross-chain transaction integrity

### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a real-time system to detect price discrepancies and arbitrage opportunities across multiple blockchain networks.
### Details:
Implement a high-performance monitoring system that tracks asset prices across different chains, calculates potential arbitrage opportunities, and filters them based on profitability thresholds. Include support for major DEXs across at least 5 blockchain networks with sub-second update intervals.

## 2. Opportunity Evaluation Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create sophisticated algorithms to evaluate and rank cross-chain arbitrage opportunities based on profitability, risk, and execution feasibility.
### Details:
Develop ML-based evaluation models that consider gas costs, slippage, time sensitivity, historical success rates, and market depth. Implement a scoring system that prioritizes opportunities with optimal risk-reward profiles and execution probability.

## 3. Execution Path Optimization [pending]

### Description: Design algorithms to determine the most efficient execution paths for cross-chain arbitrage opportunities.
### Details:
Create a path optimization engine that calculates the most efficient routes across chains, considering gas costs, bridge fees, execution time, and potential slippage. Implement parallel path simulation to compare multiple execution strategies and select the optimal approach.

## 4. Bridge Risk Assessment Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive risk assessment system for cross-chain bridges to evaluate security, reliability, and liquidity risks.
### Details:
Implement a proprietary bridge scoring system that tracks historical performance, security audits, liquidity depth, transaction success rates, and governance quality. Create real-time monitoring for bridge status and anomaly detection for potential bridge exploits or failures.

## 5. Cross-Chain Liquidity Optimization [pending]
