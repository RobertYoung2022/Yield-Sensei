Compliance monitoring implementation:
```typescript
class ComplianceMonitor {
  private ruleEngines: Map<Jurisdiction, RuleEngine>;
  private kycProvider: KYCProvider;
  private chainalysisClient: ChainalysisClient;
  private trmLabsClient: TRMLabsClient;
  private perplexityClient: PerplexityClient;
  
  constructor() {
    this.ruleEngines = new Map();
    this.kycProvider = new KYCProvider(config.kyc);
    this.chainalysisClient = new ChainalysisClient(config.chainalysis);
    this.trmLabsClient = new TRMLabsClient(config.trmLabs);
    this.perplexityClient = new PerplexityClient(config.perplexity);
    
    // Initialize rule engines for each jurisdiction
    this.initializeRuleEngines();
  }
  
  async monitorTransaction(transaction: Transaction, user: User): Promise<ComplianceResult> {
    // Check jurisdiction-specific rules
    const userJurisdiction = user.jurisdiction;
    const ruleEngine = this.ruleEngines.get(userJurisdiction);
    const ruleCompliance = await ruleEngine.evaluateTransaction(transaction);
    
    // Check transaction against Chainalysis and TRM Labs
    const [chainalysisResult, trmLabsResult] = await Promise.all([
      this.chainalysisClient.checkTransaction(transaction),
      this.trmLabsClient.analyzeTransaction(transaction)
    ]);
    
    // Get regulatory intelligence from Perplexity
    const regulatoryContext = await this.perplexityClient.getRegulatoryContext(transaction, userJurisdiction);
    
    // Combine all results into a compliance decision
    return this.makeComplianceDecision(ruleCompliance, chainalysisResult, trmLabsResult, regulatoryContext);
  }
  
  async verifyUserCompliance(user: User, activityLevel: ActivityLevel): Promise<UserComplianceStatus> {
    // Determine required KYC level based on activity
    const requiredKycLevel = this.determineRequiredKycLevel(user.jurisdiction, activityLevel);
    
    // Check if user meets the required KYC level
    const kycStatus = await this.kycProvider.checkUserStatus(user.id, requiredKycLevel);
    
    // Get additional compliance context from Perplexity
    const complianceContext = await this.perplexityClient.getUserComplianceContext(user);
    
    return {
      compliant: kycStatus.verified && kycStatus.level >= requiredKycLevel,
      kycStatus,
      requiredActions: this.determineRequiredActions(kycStatus, requiredKycLevel),
      complianceContext
    };
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Compliance testing with regulatory requirements across jurisdictions
2. Integration testing with KYC/AML providers
3. Validation of transaction monitoring against known suspicious patterns
4. Performance testing for real-time compliance checks
5. Security testing for sensitive compliance data
6. Scenario testing with various regulatory change events
7. End-to-end testing of complete compliance workflows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Real-time Compliance Monitoring System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a real-time compliance monitoring system that tracks regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions and alerts on potential violations.
### Details:
Implement jurisdiction-specific rule engines, regulatory change detection mechanisms, and compliance scoring algorithms. Create dashboards for compliance officers with real-time alerts and risk indicators. Develop automated reporting capabilities for regulatory requirements across different jurisdictions.

## 2. KYC/AML Workflow Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate KYC/AML verification processes into the platform workflow with tiered requirements based on user type and activity level.
### Details:
