# Description: Develop and implement a comprehensive security testing framework to validate all security improvements, encryption mechanisms, and secret management systems before proceeding with further development.
# Details:
Implement a robust security testing and validation framework with the following components:

1. Secret management validation

   - Create validation scripts to ensure all secrets are properly stored in the secret management system
   - Implement tests to verify secret rotation mechanisms function correctly
   - Validate access controls for secrets across different user roles and permissions

2. Encryption validation
   - Develop tests to verify data encryption at rest is properly implemented
   - Create validation for encryption in transit across all API endpoints
   - Implement cryptographic validation to ensure proper key lengths and algorithms
   - Test key rotation mechanisms and verify data remains accessible
   - Validate encrypted database connections across all environments

3. Security measure verification
   - Implement comprehensive penetration testing suite for all critical endpoints
   - Create automated security scanning integration with CI/CD pipeline
   - Develop validation for input sanitization and protection against injection attacks
   - Implement tests for authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Create validation for session management and token security

4. Environment configuration validation
   - Develop tests to verify environment-specific security configurations
   - Create validation for required security-related environment variables
   - Implement tests to ensure proper fallbacks and defaults don't compromise security
   - Validate configuration loading with intentionally malformed inputs

5. Compliance verification
   - Implement tests to verify regulatory compliance requirements are met
   - Create validation scripts for audit logging and monitoring
   - Develop tests to ensure PII/sensitive data handling meets requirements
   - Validate security measures against industry standards (OWASP, NIST, etc.)

6. Documentation and reporting
   - Create comprehensive security testing documentation
   - Implement automated security test reporting
   - Develop risk assessment documentation for any accepted vulnerabilities
   - Create remediation plans for any identified issues

# Test Strategy:
1. Automated security testing
   - Run comprehensive automated security test suite covering all implemented security measures
   - Verify all tests pass with appropriate coverage metrics
   - Validate test results against security requirements
   - Document any false positives and adjust tests accordingly

2. Manual penetration testing
   - Conduct thorough manual penetration testing on all critical endpoints
   - Attempt to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.)
   - Document findings and verify remediation

3. Secret management validation
   - Verify no secrets can be extracted from the codebase or configuration
   - Test secret rotation without service disruption
   - Validate proper secret access controls across different user roles
   - Verify secrets are properly encrypted at rest and in transit

4. Encryption validation
   - Verify all sensitive data is properly encrypted at rest
   - Test encryption in transit across all communication channels
   - Validate cryptographic implementations against industry standards
   - Verify key management procedures and rotation mechanisms

5. Environment configuration testing
   - Test security configurations across all environments (dev, staging, production)
   - Verify proper validation of security-related environment variables
   - Test configuration with missing or invalid security settings
   - Validate error handling for security configuration issues

6. Compliance verification
   - Verify all implemented security measures meet regulatory requirements
   - Test audit logging for completeness and accuracy
   - Validate PII/sensitive data handling procedures
   - Document compliance status for all security requirements

## Encryption Mechanism Validation Framework Implementation

Successfully implemented a comprehensive encryption validation framework at `src/security/testing/encryption-validation-framework.ts` with four core testing categories:

1. **Data at Rest Encryption Tests**: AES-256-GCM validation with proper key length and authentication tag verification, and Database TDE configuration checking

2. **Data in Transit Encryption Tests**: TLS configuration validation and API endpoint HTTPS enforcement with HSTS validation

3. **Key Management Tests**: Key rotation mechanism validation with grace period support and PBKDF2 key derivation function testing

4. **Algorithm Compliance Tests**: FIPS 140-2 approved algorithms verification and cryptographic entropy quality assessment

Created a CLI interface (`src/security/testing/encryption-validation-cli.ts`) with commands for full validation, quick critical tests, test listing, baseline generation, and comparison. Implemented a comprehensive test suite at `tests/security/testing/encryption-validation-simple.test.ts`.

Added npm scripts for all validation operations and integrated multi-format reporting (JSON, HTML, CSV). The framework successfully detects vulnerabilities including weak algorithms, insufficient key lengths, improper encryption modes, and configuration issues while providing performance metrics and compliance checking against FIPS 140-2, PCI-DSS, SOC2, and NIST standards.

## 2. Environment Variable and Configuration Security Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement tests to validate that all required security-related environment variables are present, correctly configured, and do not expose sensitive information or default insecure values.
### Details:
This subtask includes verifying environment-specific security configurations, checking for the presence and correctness of environment variables, and testing configuration loading with malformed or missing inputs to ensure robust fallback mechanisms.

## 3. Database Security Testing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and execute tests to ensure all database connections are encrypted, access controls are enforced, and sensitive data is properly protected both at rest and in transit.
### Details:
This subtask focuses on validating encrypted database connections, verifying user and role-based access controls, and ensuring that sensitive fields are encrypted and not exposed through logs or error messages.

## 4. Comprehensive Security Measure Verification [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a suite of tests to verify all security measures, including authentication, authorization, input validation, session management, and protection against common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
### Details:

## 5. Security Compliance and Reporting Validation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and execute tests to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, proper audit logging, and reporting of security test results, including risk assessment and remediation planning.
### Details:
