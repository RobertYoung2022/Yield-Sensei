        self.tvl_analyzer = self._load_tvl_analyzer()
        self.team_evaluator = self._load_team_evaluator()
        
    def evaluate_protocol(self, protocol_data):
        risk_score = self.risk_model.predict(protocol_data)
        tvl_health = self.tvl_analyzer.analyze(protocol_data['tvl_history'])
        team_score = self.team_evaluator.score(protocol_data['team'])
        
        return {
            'overall_score': self._calculate_overall_score(risk_score, tvl_health, team_score),
            'risk_assessment': risk_score,
            'tvl_health': tvl_health,
            'team_assessment': team_score
