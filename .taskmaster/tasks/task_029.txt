# Task ID: 29
# Title: Staging Environment Setup & Launch Readiness
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 35, 27, 26, 25, 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a comprehensive staging environment that mirrors production for final testing, UAT, and launch preparation, including infrastructure configuration, deployment automation, and monitoring setup.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive staging environment with the following components:

1. Infrastructure Setup
   - Provision cloud resources that mirror production specifications (compute, storage, networking)
   - Implement infrastructure-as-code using Terraform/Pulumi to ensure environment consistency
   - Configure network security groups, VPCs, and access controls matching production security posture
   - Set up load balancers, auto-scaling groups, and high-availability configurations
   - Implement database clusters with production-equivalent schemas and anonymized data

2. Environment Configuration
   - Integrate with the existing environment configuration system (Task 14)
   - Create staging-specific environment variables and configuration files
   - Implement secure secret rotation and management for staging credentials
   - Configure feature flags for controlled feature testing
   - Establish clear separation between staging and production resources

3. Deployment Automation
   - Create CI/CD pipeline extensions for staging deployments
   - Implement blue-green deployment capability for zero-downtime updates
   - Configure automated database migrations with rollback capabilities
   - Set up deployment approval gates and validation checks
   - Develop automated smoke tests that run post-deployment

4. Monitoring & Observability
   - Configure application performance monitoring (APM) tools
   - Set up distributed tracing across all services
   - Implement comprehensive logging with centralized log aggregation
   - Configure alerting thresholds and notification channels
   - Create staging-specific dashboards for key performance metrics

5. Compliance & Security Validation
   - Implement automated security scanning in the staging pipeline
   - Configure compliance validation checks for regulatory requirements
   - Set up data privacy controls for any production-like data
   - Implement penetration testing infrastructure
   - Configure security monitoring and threat detection

6. UAT Environment Preparation
   - Create isolated UAT testing spaces within staging
   - Develop user acceptance testing scripts and scenarios
   - Configure test data generation and management
   - Implement user feedback collection mechanisms
   - Set up demonstration environments for stakeholder reviews

7. Launch Readiness Validation
   - Create a comprehensive pre-launch checklist
   - Implement automated readiness validation tests
   - Configure performance benchmarking tools
   - Develop rollback procedures and disaster recovery plans
   - Create launch day runbooks and operational procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Infrastructure Validation
   - Verify all infrastructure components match production specifications
   - Conduct load testing to validate capacity and scaling capabilities
   - Test failover mechanisms and high-availability configurations
   - Validate network security configurations and access controls
   - Verify data persistence and backup/restore functionality

2. Configuration Testing
   - Validate all environment variables and configuration settings
   - Test secret management and rotation procedures
   - Verify feature flag functionality and control mechanisms
   - Conduct configuration drift detection tests
   - Validate environment isolation from production systems

3. Deployment Pipeline Verification
   - Execute end-to-end deployment tests through the CI/CD pipeline
   - Validate blue-green deployment functionality
   - Test database migration and rollback procedures
   - Verify deployment approval gates and validation checks
   - Conduct post-deployment smoke tests and validation

4. Monitoring System Validation
   - Verify all monitoring tools are correctly configured and collecting data
   - Test alerting thresholds by simulating error conditions
   - Validate log collection and aggregation across all services
   - Verify distributed tracing functionality across service boundaries
   - Test dashboard functionality and metric accuracy

5. Security and Compliance Validation
   - Execute automated security scans and address findings
   - Conduct penetration testing against staging environment
   - Verify compliance with regulatory requirements
   - Test data privacy controls and anonymization
   - Validate security monitoring and alerting functionality

6. User Acceptance Testing
   - Conduct end-to-end user flows with test accounts
   - Verify all business processes function correctly
   - Test edge cases and error handling
   - Collect and address user feedback
   - Validate integration with external systems and APIs

7. Performance and Scalability Testing
   - Execute load tests simulating expected production traffic
   - Conduct stress tests to identify breaking points
   - Measure response times and transaction throughput
   - Validate auto-scaling functionality under load
   - Benchmark resource utilization and optimize as needed

8. Launch Readiness Verification
   - Execute all items on the pre-launch checklist
   - Conduct a full rehearsal of the launch process
   - Test rollback procedures and disaster recovery
   - Verify all documentation is complete and accurate
   - Conduct a final stakeholder review and sign-off
