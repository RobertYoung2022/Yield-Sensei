# Task ID: 30
# Title: AI Assistant Enhancement: Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering Evaluation and Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Evaluate and implement advanced AI assistant capabilities for YieldSensei by comparing fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and hybrid approaches, selecting and deploying the optimal method to maximize intelligence, accuracy, and user experience.
# Details:
1. Requirements Analysis: Collaborate with stakeholders to define specific intelligence, interaction, and domain requirements for the AI assistant within YieldSensei, including expected use cases, data privacy constraints, and integration points with existing satellites.

2. Comparative Evaluation:
   - Fine-Tuning: Assess feasibility of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using proprietary or domain-specific data. Consider data volume, annotation requirements, infrastructure (GPU/TPU), and ongoing maintenance costs. Evaluate open-source and commercial LLMs for compatibility and licensing.
   - Prompt Engineering: Develop and test advanced prompt templates, leveraging context injection, chain-of-thought, and role-based prompting patterns. Explore prompt chaining, few-shot examples, and dynamic prompt construction to maximize model performance without retraining.
   - Hybrid/Alternative Approaches: Investigate Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to combine prompt engineering with external knowledge retrieval, if relevant to YieldSensei’s needs.

3. Prototyping & Benchmarking:
   - Build prototypes for both fine-tuned and prompt-engineered solutions using representative tasks (e.g., protocol analysis, sentiment synthesis, risk explanations).
   - Define objective evaluation metrics: accuracy, latency, cost, maintainability, and adaptability to new requirements.
   - Run controlled experiments and user studies to compare approaches.

4. Selection & Implementation:
   - Select the approach (or combination) that best meets YieldSensei’s requirements based on empirical results and resource constraints.
   - For fine-tuning: Prepare datasets, configure training pipelines, and deploy the fine-tuned model with robust monitoring.
   - For prompt engineering: Implement prompt management infrastructure, versioning, and automated prompt testing.
   - Integrate the chosen solution with the core system and relevant satellites (e.g., Sage, Echo, Aegis, Forge, Pulse, Oracle, Bridge).

5. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer:
   - Document decision rationale, implementation details, and operational guidelines for future maintenance and scaling.
   - Provide training to internal teams on prompt design or fine-tuning workflows as appropriate.

Best practices include: using modular prompt templates, automated prompt regression testing, data versioning for fine-tuning, and continuous evaluation pipelines. Consider security implications (e.g., prompt injection attacks) and implement safeguards accordingly.

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional Testing: Validate that the AI assistant meets all defined use cases and produces accurate, contextually relevant responses across a range of scenarios.
2. Benchmarking: Measure and compare accuracy, latency, and cost between fine-tuned and prompt-engineered solutions using standardized tasks and datasets.
3. User Acceptance Testing: Conduct user studies with internal stakeholders to assess perceived intelligence, usability, and adaptability.
4. Integration Testing: Ensure seamless operation with all relevant satellites (Sage, Echo, Aegis, Forge, Pulse, Oracle, Bridge) and the core system.
5. Security Testing: Simulate prompt injection and adversarial attacks to verify robustness and implement mitigations.
6. Regression Testing: Establish automated tests to detect performance or accuracy regressions as prompts or models evolve.
7. Monitoring: Deploy monitoring for response quality, error rates, and system health in production.
