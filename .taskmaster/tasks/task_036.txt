# Task ID: 36
# Title: AI Service Integration Layer Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 33
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a unified AI service adapter for satellite integration, enabling intelligent provider routing, load balancing, configuration management, shared caching, rate limiting, and cross-satellite AI coordination.
# Details:
Design and implement a modular AI service integration layer that abstracts multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity) behind a unified interface. 

Key components:
- **Provider Adapter Abstraction**: Create a pluggable adapter system for each AI provider, standardizing request/response formats and error handling. Ensure adapters can be dynamically configured and extended for new providers.
- **Configuration Management**: Implement a configuration subsystem allowing runtime selection and prioritization of AI providers based on user, satellite, or system-wide preferences. Support hot-reload and secure storage of API credentials.
- **Shared Caching and Rate Limiting**: Integrate a distributed caching layer (e.g., Redis) for prompt/response deduplication and latency reduction. Implement provider-specific and global rate limiters to prevent quota exhaustion and ensure fair usage across satellites.
- **Intelligent Provider Routing & Load Balancing**: Develop algorithms to route requests based on provider health, cost, latency, and usage quotas. Support fallback and failover strategies for degraded or unavailable providers.
- **Unified Usage Tracking & Cost Optimization**: Track usage metrics (tokens, requests, costs) per provider, satellite, and user. Implement cost-aware routing and alerting for quota/cost thresholds.
- **Cross-Satellite AI Coordination**: Build a coordination mechanism (e.g., via message bus or shared state) to enable satellites to share AI insights, synchronize cache, and coordinate analysis tasks for improved efficiency and consistency.
- **Security & Compliance**: Ensure all API keys and sensitive data are securely managed. Implement audit logging for all AI interactions.

Considerations:
- Design for extensibility to support future AI providers and new satellite types.
- Ensure high availability and graceful degradation in case of provider outages.
- Optimize for minimal latency and efficient resource utilization across the constellation.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**: Validate each provider adapter for correct request/response handling, error management, and configuration overrides.
2. **Integration Testing**: Simulate multi-provider scenarios, including failover, load balancing, and quota exhaustion. Test configuration changes at runtime.
3. **Performance Testing**: Benchmark caching efficiency, rate limiter accuracy, and end-to-end latency under concurrent load from multiple satellites.
4. **Usage Tracking Validation**: Verify accuracy of usage and cost metrics across providers and satellites.
5. **Cross-Satellite Coordination Testing**: Simulate coordinated AI tasks and cache sharing between satellites, ensuring consistency and correctness.
6. **Security Testing**: Audit API key management, access controls, and logging for compliance.
7. **Fault Injection**: Test system behavior under provider outages, network failures, and misconfiguration scenarios.
