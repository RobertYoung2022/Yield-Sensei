# Task ID: 1
# Title: Multi-Agent Orchestration System Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the core multi-agent orchestration system that will serve as the foundation for the YieldSensei satellite model.
# Details:
Create a modular architecture for the multi-agent system using Rust for performance-critical components and TypeScript for integration layers. The system should:

1. Define communication protocols between satellites
2. Implement agent lifecycle management (creation, monitoring, termination)
3. Create a message bus for inter-agent communication
4. Design state management for distributed agent operations
5. Implement fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
6. Create logging and monitoring infrastructure

Pseudo-code for agent orchestration:
```rust
pub struct AgentManager {
    agents: HashMap<AgentId, Box<dyn Agent>>,
    message_bus: Arc<MessageBus>,
    state_store: Arc<StateStore>,
}

impl AgentManager {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn register_agent(&mut self, agent: Box<dyn Agent>) -> AgentId { ... }
    pub fn start_agent(&self, id: AgentId) -> Result<(), AgentError> { ... }
    pub fn stop_agent(&self, id: AgentId) -> Result<(), AgentError> { ... }
    pub fn send_message(&self, from: AgentId, to: AgentId, message: Message) -> Result<(), MessageError> { ... }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each component of the orchestration system
2. Integration tests for agent communication
3. Stress tests with simulated high message volume
4. Fault injection testing to verify recovery mechanisms
5. Performance benchmarks to ensure <100ms response time for critical operations
6. End-to-end tests with mock agents representing each satellite

## 4. Distributed State Management [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a system for managing shared state across distributed agent instances
### Details:
Create a distributed state management solution with: eventual consistency guarantees, conflict resolution strategies, state replication mechanisms, optimistic concurrency control, state versioning and history, and efficient state synchronization protocols. Implement caching strategies to minimize network overhead and ensure state access patterns are optimized for the agent system's needs.
<info added on 2025-07-20T07:57:33.667Z>
Implementation will use Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to ensure eventual consistency in our distributed state management system. Core components will be developed in Rust for performance and safety, with TypeScript bindings via WebAssembly for integration with the broader system. The architecture will employ a two-tier caching strategy: a distributed Redis cache for shared state across satellites, complemented by local caches within each satellite to minimize network overhead. This approach will provide the conflict resolution, state replication, and synchronization capabilities required while maintaining performance at scale.

## 5. Fault Tolerance and Recovery [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement mechanisms for detecting failures and recovering from system disruptions
### Details:
Develop a comprehensive fault tolerance system including: automated failure detection, agent redundancy and failover mechanisms, state recovery procedures, circuit breakers for preventing cascading failures, retry policies with exponential backoff, and disaster recovery planning. Document recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO) for different failure scenarios.
<info added on 2025-07-20T08:10:30.894Z>
Based on our research findings, we will implement a focused fault tolerance approach with three key components:

1. Circuit breakers using the `opossum` library to prevent system overload during failures, automatically detecting and isolating problematic components.

2. Retry policies with exponential backoff to handle transient failures, gradually increasing wait times between retry attempts to avoid overwhelming recovering services.

3. Enhanced automated failure detection integrated with our existing lifecycle manager, providing real-time monitoring of agent health and performance metrics to enable proactive intervention before critical failures occur.

These implementations will prioritize system resilience while maintaining performance, with particular attention to integration points between distributed components.
