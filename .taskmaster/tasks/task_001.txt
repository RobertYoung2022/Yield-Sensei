# Task ID: 1
# Title: Multi-Agent Orchestration System Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the core multi-agent orchestration system that will serve as the foundation for the YieldSensei satellite model.
# Details:
Create a modular architecture for the multi-agent system using Rust for performance-critical components and TypeScript for integration layers. The system should:

1. Define communication protocols between satellites
2. Implement agent lifecycle management (creation, monitoring, termination)
3. Create a message bus for inter-agent communication
4. Design state management for distributed agent operations
5. Implement fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms
6. Create logging and monitoring infrastructure

Pseudo-code for agent orchestration:
```rust
pub struct AgentManager {
    agents: HashMap<AgentId, Box<dyn Agent>>,
    message_bus: Arc<MessageBus>,
    state_store: Arc<StateStore>,
}

impl AgentManager {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn register_agent(&mut self, agent: Box<dyn Agent>) -> AgentId { ... }
    pub fn start_agent(&self, id: AgentId) -> Result<(), AgentError> { ... }
    pub fn stop_agent(&self, id: AgentId) -> Result<(), AgentError> { ... }
    pub fn send_message(&self, from: AgentId, to: AgentId, message: Message) -> Result<(), MessageError> { ... }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each component of the orchestration system
2. Integration tests for agent communication
3. Stress tests with simulated high message volume
4. Fault injection testing to verify recovery mechanisms
5. Performance benchmarks to ensure <100ms response time for critical operations
6. End-to-end tests with mock agents representing each satellite
