# Task ID: 2
# Title: Database Architecture Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the core database infrastructure using PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Redis, and Vector DB as specified in the PRD.
# Details:
Implement a multi-tiered database architecture:

1. PostgreSQL for transaction history and relational data
   - Design schemas for user accounts, portfolio holdings, transaction history
   - Implement partitioning strategy for historical data
   - Set up replication for high availability

2. ClickHouse for high-frequency market data
   - Create tables optimized for time-series data
   - Implement efficient compression and partitioning
   - Design query optimization for real-time analytics

3. Redis for real-time caching
   - Configure cache invalidation strategies
   - Set up pub/sub for real-time updates
   - Implement rate limiting and request queuing

4. Vector DB for ML model storage
   - Configure for storing embeddings and model weights
   - Optimize for fast similarity searches
   - Implement versioning for model iterations

5. Apache Kafka for message streaming
   - Set up topics for different data streams
   - Configure consumer groups for different services
   - Implement retention policies

Database connection code example:
```typescript
class DatabaseManager {
  private pgPool: Pool;
  private clickhouseClient: ClickHouseClient;
  private redisClient: RedisClient;
  private vectorDb: VectorDB;
  
  constructor() {
    this.pgPool = new Pool(config.postgres);
    this.clickhouseClient = new ClickHouseClient(config.clickhouse);
    this.redisClient = new RedisClient(config.redis);
    this.vectorDb = new VectorDB(config.vectorDb);
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    await this.setupSchemas();
    await this.setupReplication();
    await this.setupCaching();
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Performance testing to ensure database meets latency requirements (<200ms for API responses)
2. Load testing with simulated high-frequency data ingestion
3. Failover testing to verify high availability
4. Data integrity tests across different storage systems
5. Benchmark query performance for common operations
6. Integration tests with application services
