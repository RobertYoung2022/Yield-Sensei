# Subtasks:
## 1. Yield Optimization Engine Development [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core yield optimization engine that calculates and compares APYs across different protocols
### Details:
Develop proprietary APY prediction models, implement risk-adjusted yield calculations, create protocol-specific optimization strategies, and design auto-compounding mechanisms. The engine should dynamically adjust strategies based on market conditions and user risk preferences.

## 2. Liquid Staking Strategy Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build specialized algorithms for liquid staking optimization across multiple protocols
### Details:
Implement custom risk calculations for liquid staking tokens, create staking reward maximization algorithms, develop validator selection strategies, and design restaking optimization for maximum capital efficiency. Include support for major liquid staking protocols like Lido, Rocket Pool, and others.

## 3. DeFAI Protocol Discovery System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an automated system to discover and analyze new DeFi protocols for yield opportunities
### Details:
Develop a protocol discovery mechanism that identifies new yield opportunities, implements protocol-specific adapters for data extraction, creates standardized interfaces for protocol interaction, and designs a scoring system for protocol reliability and sustainability.

## 4. Sustainable Yield Detection Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop algorithms to differentiate between sustainable and unsustainable yield sources
### Details:
Implement tokenomics analysis for yield sustainability, create emission schedule modeling, develop liquidity depth assessment, and design historical yield stability tracking. The algorithms should flag potentially unsustainable yields and prioritize long-term reliable opportunities.

## 5. Perplexity API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate with Perplexity API for enhanced protocol research and yield analysis
### Details:
Implement API connection and authentication, develop query generation for protocol research, create response parsing and data extraction, and design a caching system for efficient API usage. The integration should enhance the system's ability to gather qualitative information about protocols.

## 6. Backtesting and Validation Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a comprehensive framework for backtesting yield strategies against historical data
### Details:
Develop historical data collection for DeFi protocols, implement strategy simulation against past market conditions, create performance metrics calculation (Sharpe ratio, drawdowns, etc.), and design visualization tools for strategy comparison. The framework should validate the effectiveness of optimization strategies.
