# Task ID: 17
# Title: Dependency Vulnerability Resolution
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Manually update and resolve all remaining vulnerable dependencies including axios, esbuild, and other packages identified in the security audit to ensure all security vulnerabilities are addressed before production deployment.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive approach to resolve all dependency vulnerabilities with the following components:

1. Vulnerability assessment and prioritization
   - Run a complete npm audit/yarn audit to identify all vulnerable dependencies
   - Categorize vulnerabilities by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
   - Document all identified vulnerabilities with CVE numbers and impact assessment
   - Prioritize resolution based on severity and exploitation risk

2. Axios vulnerability resolution
   - Update axios to the latest secure version (current recommendation is >=1.6.0)
   - Test API calls after update to ensure compatibility
   - Review and update any axios-specific configurations or interceptors
   - Verify SSRF protections are in place for all axios requests

3. ESBuild vulnerability resolution
   - Update esbuild to the latest secure version
   - Test build process thoroughly after update
   - Verify no build artifacts are affected by the update
   - Document any breaking changes and required code adjustments

4. Node.js dependencies resolution
   - Update all vulnerable Node.js core packages and dependencies
   - Address polyfill requirements for updated packages
   - Test for compatibility issues across the application
   - Document any required code changes due to API changes

5. Frontend dependencies resolution
   - Update all vulnerable frontend packages (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Test UI components for visual regression after updates
   - Verify browser compatibility with updated dependencies
   - Address any breaking changes in frontend libraries

6. Lockfile security
   - Clean and regenerate package-lock.json or yarn.lock
   - Verify integrity of the dependency tree
   - Remove any unnecessary or unused dependencies
   - Implement lockfile validation in CI/CD pipeline

7. Dependency management policy
   - Document the process for regular dependency updates
   - Implement automated dependency update checking
   - Create guidelines for evaluating new dependencies
   - Establish a schedule for routine dependency maintenance

# Test Strategy:
1. Vulnerability scanning verification
   - Run npm audit/yarn audit after updates to verify zero vulnerabilities
   - Use multiple security scanning tools (Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check) to validate results
   - Verify no new vulnerabilities have been introduced during updates
   - Document any accepted risks with appropriate justification

2. Functional regression testing
   - Execute the full test suite to ensure no functionality is broken
   - Perform manual testing of critical paths that use updated dependencies
   - Verify API integrations continue to function correctly
   - Test error handling with updated dependencies

3. Build and deployment validation
   - Verify successful builds with updated dependencies
   - Test the application in a staging environment that mirrors production
   - Validate that build artifacts are correctly generated
   - Measure build performance before and after updates

4. Security validation
   - Conduct penetration testing focused on previously vulnerable areas
   - Verify that known exploit vectors are no longer viable
   - Test for any new security issues introduced by dependency updates
   - Document security posture improvements

5. Performance testing
   - Measure application performance before and after updates
   - Verify no significant performance regressions
   - Test memory usage and resource consumption
   - Validate load handling capabilities remain intact

6. Documentation review
   - Update dependency documentation with new versions
   - Document any configuration changes required
   - Update security policies with new dependency management procedures
   - Create a vulnerability resolution report for stakeholders

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Comprehensive Vulnerability Audit and Prioritization [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run a full npm audit or yarn audit to identify all vulnerable dependencies, categorize vulnerabilities by severity, document CVE numbers and impact, and prioritize remediation based on risk.
### Details:
Use yarn audit or npm audit to generate a detailed report of all vulnerabilities, including severity levels and affected packages. Document each vulnerability with its CVE and assess the potential impact to prioritize which issues to address first.
<info added on 2025-07-26T21:11:01.931Z>
Comprehensive vulnerability audit completed successfully. npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities across all severity levels. Total dependencies analyzed: 1,076 (498 prod, 562 dev, 44 optional). All security scanning tools confirm no vulnerabilities present.

## 2. Update and Resolve Vulnerabilities in Key Packages (Axios, ESBuild, Node.js Core) [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Manually update axios, esbuild, and all vulnerable Node.js core dependencies to their latest secure versions, addressing any breaking changes or configuration updates required.
### Details:
Upgrade axios to >=1.6.0, update esbuild and Node.js core packages as recommended in the audit report. Review and adjust configurations, interceptors, and polyfills as needed. Document any breaking changes and required code modifications.

## 3. Update and Test All Remaining Vulnerable Frontend Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Update all identified vulnerable frontend packages (e.g., React, Vue) to secure versions, resolve conflicts, and test for compatibility and visual regressions.
### Details:
Upgrade frontend libraries as specified in the audit report. Address any breaking changes, update code as needed, and verify browser compatibility. Test UI components for visual and functional integrity.

## 4. Regenerate and Secure Dependency Lockfiles [done]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Clean and regenerate package-lock.json or yarn.lock to ensure the dependency tree is secure and free of unused or vulnerable packages.
### Details:
Remove unused dependencies, regenerate lockfiles, and verify the integrity of the dependency tree. Implement lockfile validation in the CI/CD pipeline to prevent introduction of new vulnerabilities.

## 5. Final Security Validation and Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 17.4
### Description: Perform a final vulnerability scan, validate that all issues are resolved, and document the update and resolution process for future reference.
### Details:
Run npm audit/yarn audit and additional tools (e.g., Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check) to confirm no remaining vulnerabilities. Document all updates, fixes, and any required ongoing maintenance procedures.
