  private apiKey: string;
  private rateLimiter: RateLimiter;
  private cache: Cache;
  private retryPolicy: RetryPolicy;
  
  constructor(apiKey: string) {
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter({
      maxRequests: 100,
      perTimeWindow: '1m',
      queueSize: 1000
    });
    this.cache = new Cache({
      ttl: '15m',
      maxSize: 1000
    });
    this.retryPolicy = new RetryPolicy({
      maxRetries: 3,
      backoffFactor: 1.5,
      initialDelay: 1000
    });
  }
  
  async getSecFilings(company: string, period?: DateRange): Promise<SECFiling[]> {
    const cacheKey = `sec_filings:${company}:${period?.toString() || 'all'}`;
    const cached = this.cache.get<SECFiling[]>(cacheKey);
    
    if (cached) return cached;
    
    return this.rateLimiter.execute(async () => {
      try {
        const response = await this.makeRequest('/financial-data/sec-filings', {
          company,
          period
        });
        
        const filings = response.data.filings;
        this.cache.set(cacheKey, filings);
        return filings;
      } catch (error) {
        if (this.shouldRetry(error)) {
          return this.retryPolicy.execute(() => this.getSecFilings(company, period));
        }
        throw error;
      }
    });
  }
  
  async getRegulatoryAlerts(jurisdictions: string[]): Promise<RegulatoryAlert[]> {
    // Implementation for regulatory alerts
  }
  
  async getAnalystSentiment(asset: string): Promise<AnalystSentiment> {
    // Implementation for analyst sentiment
  }
  
  async generateComplianceReport(data: ReportData, format: 'csv' | 'excel'): Promise<ReportResult> {
    // Implementation for report generation
  }
}
```
