  private perplexityClient: PerplexityClient;
  
  constructor() {
    this.nlpModel = new NLPModel();
    this.entityRecognizer = new EntityRecognizer();
    this.trendDetector = new TrendDetector();
    this.perplexityClient = new PerplexityClient(config.perplexity.apiKey);
  }
  
  async analyzeSocialPost(post: SocialPost): Promise<SentimentAnalysis> {
    const entities = await this.entityRecognizer.extractEntities(post.content);
    const rawSentiment = await this.nlpModel.analyzeSentiment(post.content);
    const enrichedSentiment = await this.enrichWithPerplexity(entities, rawSentiment);
    
    return {
      entities,
      sentiment: enrichedSentiment,
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(rawSentiment, post),
      impact: this.calculateImpact(entities, post.author, post.engagement)
    };
  }
  
  async enrichWithPerplexity(entities: Entity[], rawSentiment: RawSentiment): Promise<EnrichedSentiment> {
    const newsContext = await this.perplexityClient.getFinancialNewsSentiment(entities);
    return this.combineWithNews(rawSentiment, newsContext);
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Accuracy testing for sentiment analysis against human-labeled datasets
2. Integration testing with ElizaOS social plugins
3. Performance testing for real-time sentiment processing
4. Validation of entity recognition with crypto-specific terms
5. A/B testing different sentiment models for accuracy
6. Cross-platform consistency testing for sentiment analysis
7. Trend detection validation against historical market movements
