2. Secret management testing
   - Validate secure access to the vault system
   - Test role-based access controls for different user types
   - Verify secret rotation mechanisms function correctly
   - Test recovery procedures for secret access
   - Validate encryption of secrets at rest

3. Cryptographic key validation
   - Verify key generation uses proper entropy sources
   - Test key rotation procedures
   - Validate access controls for cryptographic keys
   - Verify key backup and recovery processes
   - Test key usage in cryptographic operations

4. Security configuration testing
   - Run automated security scans on configuration
   - Test configuration validation with invalid settings
   - Verify drift detection for configuration changes
   - Validate audit logging for configuration access
   - Test alert mechanisms for security issues

5. Integration testing
   - Verify CI/CD pipeline integration with secrets

## 2. Secret Management Infrastructure Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Set up a secure vault system (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) and implement role-based access control for secrets.
### Details:
Create rotation policies for sensitive credentials and develop a secure local development workflow that doesn't expose production secrets.
<info added on 2025-07-20T22:55:42.399Z>
Implemented a comprehensive secret management infrastructure with multiple components:

1. Vault Manager with encryption, multi-backend support, metadata management, version control, and audit logging
2. Access Control Manager with RBAC, user management, permission conditions, and audit logging
3. Rotation Manager for automatic/manual secret rotation with configurable policies and audit reporting
4. Unified Secret Manager integrating all components with comprehensive operations
5. CLI Management Tool for all secret operations
6. Package.json scripts for secret management operations
7. Comprehensive documentation in SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md

Features include AES-256-GCM encryption, role-based access control, automatic rotation, audit logging, health monitoring, multi-backend support, environment separation, notifications, and version control. Testing confirms core functionality is working with only minor non-blocking issues in CLI argument parsing and user persistence. The system is ready for integration with environment configuration, production deployment, and authentication system integration.
