# Task ID: 14
# Title: Environment Configuration and Secret Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a secure environment configuration system with proper secret management, cryptographic key generation, and validation mechanisms to support secure deployment across all environments.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive environment configuration and secret management system with the following components:

1. Environment variable management
   - Create a secure template for environment variables (.env.example)
   - Implement environment-specific configurations (development, staging, production)
   - Develop a validation system to ensure all required variables are present
   - Add documentation for each environment variable and its purpose
   - Implement configuration loading with strict type checking

2. Secret management infrastructure
   - Set up a secure vault system (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager)
   - Implement role-based access control for secrets
   - Create rotation policies for sensitive credentials
   - Develop a secure local development workflow that doesn't expose production secrets
   - Implement encryption for secrets at rest

3. Cryptographic key generation
   - Create a secure process for generating cryptographic keys
   - Implement key storage with proper access controls
   - Set up key rotation mechanisms and schedules
   - Document recovery procedures for key compromise scenarios
   - Ensure proper entropy sources for key generation

4. Configuration validation
   - Develop automated validation for security configuration
   - Create health checks to verify secret accessibility
   - Implement configuration drift detection
   - Add logging for configuration changes with audit trails
   - Create alerts for security configuration issues

5. CI/CD integration
   - Integrate secret injection into CI/CD pipelines
   - Implement secure environment variable handling in build processes
   - Create deployment validation for security configuration
   - Ensure separation between environment configurations
   - Add automated security scanning for configuration files

# Test Strategy:
1. Environment configuration validation
   - Verify all required environment variables are properly validated
   - Test configuration loading with missing or invalid variables
   - Validate type checking for configuration values
   - Test environment-specific configuration loading
   - Verify configuration documentation accuracy

2. Secret management testing
   - Validate secure access to the vault system
   - Test role-based access controls for different user types
   - Verify secret rotation mechanisms function correctly
   - Test recovery procedures for secret access
   - Validate encryption of secrets at rest

3. Cryptographic key validation
   - Verify key generation uses proper entropy sources
   - Test key rotation procedures
   - Validate access controls for cryptographic keys
   - Verify key backup and recovery processes
   - Test key usage in cryptographic operations

4. Security configuration testing
   - Run automated security scans on configuration
   - Test configuration validation with invalid settings
   - Verify drift detection for configuration changes
   - Validate audit logging for configuration access
   - Test alert mechanisms for security issues

5. Integration testing
   - Verify CI/CD pipeline integration with secrets
   - Test deployment with security configuration
   - Validate application startup with security checks
   - Verify proper separation between environments
   - Test fallback mechanisms for configuration issues

## 1. Environment Variable Management Setup [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a secure template for environment variables (.env.example) and implement environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production.
### Details:
Develop a validation system to ensure all required variables are present and add documentation for each environment variable and its purpose.
<info added on 2025-07-20T22:46:21.964Z>
Environment Variable Management Setup has been successfully completed with the implementation of a comprehensive system that includes:

A robust Environment Validator that performs thorough validation of all environment variables with environment-specific rules, type validation, and security warnings.

Environment-specific configurations for development and production environments with dedicated security checklists and validation rules.

A Configuration Loader that handles loading, merging, and validating configurations with detailed error reporting capabilities.

An enhanced Environment Template with comprehensive documentation for all variables, including security requirements and best practices.

CLI Validation Tools for environment validation with reporting capabilities and CI/CD integration.

Complete documentation covering setup guides, security requirements, troubleshooting, and CI/CD integration examples.

The validation system successfully performs automatic validation of required variables, type checking, environment-specific security requirements, error reporting, and security checklist validation.

## 2. Secret Management Infrastructure Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Set up a secure vault system (HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) and implement role-based access control for secrets.
### Details:
Create rotation policies for sensitive credentials and develop a secure local development workflow that doesn't expose production secrets.
<info added on 2025-07-20T22:55:42.399Z>
Implemented a comprehensive secret management infrastructure with multiple components:

1. Vault Manager with encryption, multi-backend support, metadata management, version control, and audit logging
2. Access Control Manager with RBAC, user management, permission conditions, and audit logging
3. Rotation Manager for automatic/manual secret rotation with configurable policies and audit reporting
4. Unified Secret Manager integrating all components with comprehensive operations
5. CLI Management Tool for all secret operations
6. Package.json scripts for secret management operations
7. Comprehensive documentation in SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md

Features include AES-256-GCM encryption, role-based access control, automatic rotation, audit logging, health monitoring, multi-backend support, environment separation, notifications, and version control. Testing confirms core functionality is working with only minor non-blocking issues in CLI argument parsing and user persistence. The system is ready for integration with environment configuration, production deployment, and authentication system integration.
