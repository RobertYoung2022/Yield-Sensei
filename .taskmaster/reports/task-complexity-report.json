			"taskTitle": "Multi-Agent Orchestration System Architecture",
			"complexityScore": 10,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the architecture task by decomposing each major system concern (communication, lifecycle, message bus, state management, fault tolerance, logging/monitoring, Rust core, TypeScript integration, testing, and performance) into at least two granular engineering subtasks each. Include subtasks for protocol specification, interface definition, concurrency control, distributed consensus, and security hardening.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing a highly modular, distributed, and performance-critical multi-agent system, integrating Rust and TypeScript, with requirements for robust communication, lifecycle management, distributed state, fault tolerance, and observability. The coordination and dependency complexity is extremely high, as validated by graph-based metrics for multi-agent systems[1][2]. Industry best practices recommend further decomposition for each architectural concern, especially for distributed systems, to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability[3][4]."
