# Redis Sentinel Configuration for YieldSensei DeFi Platform
# High Availability and Automatic Failover Management

# Basic Sentinel Settings
port 26379

# Time in milliseconds for failover timeout
sentinel failover-timeout yieldsensei-master 180000

# Number of replicas to reconfigure at the same time during failover
sentinel parallel-syncs yieldsensei-master 1

# Logging
logfile /var/log/redis/sentinel.log
loglevel notice
syslog-enabled yes
syslog-ident redis-sentinel

# Connection settings
sentinel resolve-hostnames yes
sentinel announce-hostnames yes

# Notification Scripts (optional)
# sentinel notification-script yieldsensei-master /path/to/notify.sh
# sentinel client-reconfig-script yieldsensei-master /path/to/reconfig.sh

# Performance Tuning
tcp-keepalive 60

# Additional monitoring for replica lag
# Master must have at least 1 replica with lag <= 10 seconds
sentinel monitor-replica-lag yieldsensei-master 1 10

# Configuration for automatic discovery
sentinel announce-ip 0.0.0.0
sentinel announce-port 26379

# Quorum and consensus settings
# Minimum number of sentinels that need to agree about master being down
# This is set to 2 to ensure proper quorum with 3 sentinels
sentinel master-reboot-down-after-period yieldsensei-master 0

# Rename dangerous commands (same as Redis instances)
sentinel rename-command yieldsensei-master FLUSHDB ""

# Memory settings for Sentinel
# Sentinel typically uses minimal memory
# sentinel announce-ip and sentinel announce-port are used for cluster coordination
