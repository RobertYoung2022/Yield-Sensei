# Claude Code Instructions

## Development Priority Guidelines
**CRITICAL**: Complete all satellite implementations before moving to testing suites.

### Satellite Implementation Priority Order:
1. **Pulse Satellite** (Task #8) - Yield optimization - PENDING
2. **Oracle Satellite** (Task #10) - Data integrity & RWA validation - PENDING  
3. **Fuel Satellite** (Task #11) - Capital management & logistics - PENDING

### Testing Priority:
- Only begin testing suites AFTER all satellites are fully implemented
- Testing tasks (22-26, 37-38) should be deferred until satellite completion

## Task Master AI Instructions
**Import Task Master's development workflow commands and guidelines, treat as if import is in the main CLAUDE.md file.**
