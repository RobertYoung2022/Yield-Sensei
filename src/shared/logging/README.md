# Logging and Monitoring

This document outlines the design of the logging and monitoring system for YieldSensei.

## Core Components

- **Structured Logger**: A centralized logger service using `winston` that produces structured, JSON-formatted logs.
- **Trace Provider**: An OpenTelemetry trace provider to enable distributed tracing across all services.
- **Metrics Exporter**: A Prometheus metrics exporter using `prom-client` to expose key performance indicators.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Logger Service**: Create a singleton logger service that can be imported and used throughout the application.
2. **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Configure the OpenTelemetry SDK and instrument our services to generate and propagate traces.
3. **Prometheus Metrics**: Define and expose custom metrics for each satellite system.
4. **Grafana Dashboards**: Create a set of Grafana dashboards to visualize the collected logs and metrics.
