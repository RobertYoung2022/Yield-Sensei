## Test Configuration

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)
- Configures test environment for TypeScript
- Sets up coverage reporting
- Defines test patterns and timeouts
- Configures module name mapping

### Test Setup (`setup.ts`)
- Mocks external dependencies
- Provides global test utilities
- Sets up custom Jest matchers
- Configures test environment variables

## Running Tests

### All Tests
```bash
npm test:bridge-optimization
```

### Unit Tests Only
```bash
npm test:bridge-optimization:unit
```

### Integration Tests Only
```bash
npm test:bridge-optimization:integration
```

### With Coverage
```bash
npm test:bridge-optimization:coverage
```

### Watch Mode
```bash
npm test:bridge-optimization:watch
```

## Test Coverage Goals

The test suite aims for:
- **90%+ statement coverage** across all optimization components
- **85%+ branch coverage** for decision logic
- **80%+ function coverage** for all public methods
- **100% integration coverage** for critical paths

## Mock Data

### Global Test Utilities

The setup file provides global utilities for creating mock data:

- `createMockExecutionStep(overrides)` - Creates mock execution steps
- `createMockExecutionPath(overrides)` - Creates mock execution paths  
- `createMockArbitrageOpportunity(overrides)` - Creates mock arbitrage opportunities

### Custom Matchers

Custom Jest matchers for domain-specific assertions:

- `toBeWithinRange(floor, ceiling)` - Validates numeric ranges
- `toHaveValidOptimizationStructure()` - Validates optimization result structure
- `toBeOptimizationStrategy()` - Validates optimization strategy objects

## Test Scenarios

### Core Optimization Scenarios
1. **Single Path Optimization** - Basic path optimization with all components
2. **Multi-Path Comparison** - Comparing multiple execution paths
3. **Complex Multi-Chain Routes** - Testing optimization across multiple chains
4. **High-Volume Trade Optimization** - Testing with large trade amounts
5. **Low-Volume Trade Handling** - Testing with small trade amounts

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty Execution Paths** - Handling paths with no steps
2. **Invalid Chain IDs** - Graceful handling of unknown chains
3. **Extreme Gas Prices** - Optimization under high congestion
4. **Low Liquidity Scenarios** - Optimization with limited liquidity
5. **Network Failures** - Fallback behavior testing

### Performance Scenarios
1. **Concurrent Optimizations** - Multiple simultaneous optimizations
2. **Large Path Trees** - Complex paths with many steps
3. **High-Frequency Updates** - Rapid price/gas updates
4. **Memory Efficiency** - Long-running optimization sessions
5. **Time Constraints** - Optimization under strict time limits

## Expected Test Results

### Performance Benchmarks
- Path optimization should complete within **5 seconds** for standard paths
- Concurrent optimizations (5x) should complete within **10 seconds**
- Memory usage should remain stable during extended testing
- Gas price updates should process within **100ms**

### Optimization Effectiveness
- Gas cost savings of **10-30%** on optimizable paths
- Slippage reduction of **15-40%** for large trades
- Execution time improvements of **20-50%** with parallelization
- Bridge fee savings of **5-20%** through optimal routing

### Reliability Metrics
- **95%+ success rate** for path optimization
- **<1% failure rate** for optimization components
- **100% data consistency** across optimization iterations
- **Zero memory leaks** during stress testing

## Debugging Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**
   - Increase test timeout in jest.config.js
   - Check for infinite loops in optimization logic
   - Verify mock responses are properly configured

2. **Mock Failures**
   - Ensure mocks are properly reset between tests
   - Verify mock implementations match expected interfaces
   - Check that external dependencies are properly mocked

3. **Assertion Failures**
   - Use descriptive test names for easier debugging
   - Add intermediate assertions to isolate issues
   - Use custom matchers for domain-specific validations

### Test Data Generation

For debugging specific scenarios, you can create targeted test data:

```typescript
const debugOpportunity = createMockArbitrageOpportunity({
  expectedProfit: 1000,
  executionPaths: [{
    ...createMockExecutionPath(),
    steps: [
      // Add specific steps for debugging
    ]
  }]
});
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Use the provided mock utilities
3. Add both positive and negative test cases
4. Include performance considerations
5. Update this README with new test scenarios

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. Update mock data to reflect real-world scenarios
2. Adjust performance benchmarks as system improves
3. Add new test cases for edge cases discovered in production
4. Review and update coverage goals quarterly
5. Benchmark test execution time and optimize slow tests
