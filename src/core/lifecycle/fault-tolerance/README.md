# Fault Tolerance and Recovery

This document outlines the design for the fault tolerance and recovery system in YieldSensei.

## Core Components

- **Circuit Breaker**: We will use the `opossum` library to wrap all inter-service communication and external API calls. This will prevent cascading failures and allow services to recover gracefully.
- **Retry Logic**: We will implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter to handle transient network errors.
- **Health Monitor**: We will enhance the existing `AgentLifecycleManager` to include more sophisticated health checks, such as heartbeat monitoring and anomaly detection.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Circuit Breaker Module**: Create a new module that provides a simple interface for creating and managing circuit breakers.
2. **Retry Decorator**: Implement a TypeScript decorator that can be applied to any asynchronous method to add retry logic.
3. **Health Check Integration**: Integrate the new health checks into the `AgentLifecycleManager`, allowing it to automatically restart or isolate unhealthy agents.
