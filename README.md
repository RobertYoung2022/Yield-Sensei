3. **Pulse** - Growth & Optimization (Yield farming, staking)
4. **Aegis** - Security & Risk Management (Liquidation protection)
5. **Echo** - Sentiment & Community (Social monitoring, narrative analysis)
6. **Fuel** - Logistics & Capital (Gas optimization, tax management)
7. **Bridge** - Cross-Chain Operations (Multi-chain coordination)
8. **Oracle** - Data Integrity (RWA validation, off-chain verification)
